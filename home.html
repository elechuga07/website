        <p>I am a spring 2025 graduate from UTRGV with a strong passion for Android app development and web development.
             Throughout my academic journey, I have designed and developed several mobile applications, gaining hands-on experience
             with tools like Flutter and Dart. I am also proficient in web development, building websites with user-focused features 
             and services. <br><br>
             In addition to mobile and web development, I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as C++, Python, and 
             JavaScript, among others. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my skill set and stay ahead of industry trends. 
             I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can contribute to innovative projects and further develop my technical 
             expertise. With a strong foundation in computer science and a drive to continuously learn, I am eager to bring my skills
